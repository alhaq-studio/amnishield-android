# AmnShield Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-08-05

## Strategic Architectural Decisions (August 2026)
- **Direct Stripe Gateway Migration (Non-Google Builds & Web Portal):**
  - **Decision:** Deprecated Lemon Squeezy integration due to rejection of external merchant billing models. Migrated non-Google billing (`fdroid`, `universal`, Windows Desktop, Web Portal) directly to **Stripe Direct** (Stripe Checkout + Subscriptions).
  - **Rationale:** Direct Stripe integration allows full control over checkout sessions, webhook lifecycle management, recurring subscription events, and compliant merchant billing across all platforms.
  - **Client Impact:** Non-Google clients launch Stripe Web Checkout for payment and receive ECDSA-signed NIST P-256 license keys issued by Supabase Edge Webhook functions, verified offline via `LicenseValidator.kt`. Google Play builds continue using Google Play `BillingClient`.

- **Web Administration Portal Transition (July 2026):**
  - **Decision:** Suspended development on the native Android **AmnShield Guardian** app in favor of a centralized **Web Administration Console** (React/Next.js + Supabase DB/Auth).
  - **Rationale:** A web portal provides platform-agnostic parental and administrative controls (accessible from iOS, Android, and Desktop browsers). It eliminates native Android IPC Binder dependencies and conforms to Google Play's strict security/policy guidelines regarding administrative control permissions.
  - **Client Impact:** The main `AmnShield-Android` app retains its local bound API (`IAmnShieldApi.aidl` and `AmnShieldApiService.kt`) for local extensibility, but will utilize HTTPS REST sync against Supabase for parental remote configuration instead of native inter-app IPC.

## Recently Completed
- **KeyStore Recovery Architecture & Unlaunchable Startup Crash Fix (August 2026)**
  - Wrapped `EncryptedSharedPreferences.create` and `MasterKey.Builder` in `SecureKeyStore` with self-healing file deletion and fallback recovery, resolving `AEADBadTagException` / `GeneralSecurityException` crashes caused by hardware KeyStore key invalidations.
  - Added `amnshield_sync_secrets.xml` exclusions to `data_extraction_rules.xml` and `backup_rules.xml`, preventing Google Cloud Auto-Backup from syncing un-decryptable encryption keys onto fresh app reinstalls.
  - Protected `AmnShieldAccessibilityService` startup binding with defensive `runCatching` wrappers, preventing accessibility background crashes when initializing blocker modules.
- **Full Blocker Schedule Enforcement & Multi-Feature Integration (July 2026)**
  - Extended `UnifiedFeatureScheduleRule` to include `selectedWebsites`, `selectedKeywords`, and `selectedPlatforms`, allowing multi-feature schedule rules to dynamically enforce specific items during scheduled windows.
  - Refactored `AmnShieldAccessibilityService` to evaluate active schedule rules for Website Blocker, Keyword Blocker, and Reels Blocker in real-time, preventing false 24/7 blocking when schedules are inactive.
  - Defaulted `loadBlockedWebsitesApps` fallback list to empty, preventing Samsung Internet and Instagram from being falsely blocked on first launch.
- **Dynamic Self-Package Name Exclusions & Anti-Uninstall Security (July 2026)**
  - Updated `AmnShieldAccessibilityService`, `AppBlocker`, `FocusModeBlocker`, `KeywordBlocker`, and `AppInstallReceiver` to dynamically check `context.packageName` rather than hardcoded strings, supporting flavor variants (`com.alhaq.deenshield`, `com.alhaq.amnshield`) cleanly.
  - Configured dynamic `app_package_id` resource strings in `build.gradle.kts` and updated `shortcuts.xml` for launcher shortcuts.
- **License Verification & Dual-Query Billing Restore (July 2026)**
  - Updated `LicenseValidator` payload signature checks to decode Base64 strings directly matching Deno Edge Function key issuance.
  - Refactored `BillingClientWrapper` in both Playstore and Universal source sets to run concurrent queries for `INAPP` and `SUBS` types, restoring subscriptions and in-app purchases seamlessly.
- **App Picker Launcher & 24/7 Always Block Fallback (July 2026)**
  - Replaced text fields and basic checkboxes in `CreateRuleScreen` with an interactive app picker launcher connected to `SelectAppsActivity`, rendering selected apps in scrollable filter chips.
  - Implemented 24/7 full-block fallback (`00:00 - 23:59`, all 7 days) when rules are saved without specific time ranges.
- **Focus Space Architecture Unification & Auto Focus Schedules (July 2026)**
  - Unified Focus Space into two clean modes: **Quick Focus Sessions** (Mode A - instant timer) and **Auto Focus Schedules** (Mode B - time window schedules & active days).
  - Added `"Focus Mode"` to schedule target options in `BlocksManagerFragment`.
  - Configured `CreateRuleScreen` as an Auto Focus Schedule Creator with clock time pickers, active days selection, whitelisting/blacklisting mode options, and app selection.
- **App Blocker Legacy View Cleanup (July 2026)**
  - Cleaned up `AppBlockerConfigFragment` to route directly to `BlocksManagerFragment`.
  - Removed legacy `SelectAppsActivity` launchers and legacy auto-block card views, ensuring 100% rule-based management routing.
- **Android Home Screen Widgets Suite & In-App Widgets Manager (July 2026)**
  - **Screen Time Widget (`ScreentimeWidgetProvider`):** Emerald Calm dark glass card displaying live daily total screen time and top 3 app usage formatting.
  - **Reels & Shorts Metrics Widget (`ReelsMetricsWidgetProvider`):** Live count of Reels scrolled today, daily limit progress, and active status badge.
  - **Quick Focus Space Widget (`QuickFocusWidgetProvider`):** Active countdown display with 3 interactive 1-tap quick start buttons (`15m`, `30m`, `60m`).
  - **Mindful Breathing Space Widget (`BreathingWidgetProvider`):** 1-tap launcher for interactive Mindful Breathing in Focus Space.
  - **In-App Widgets Manager:** Built live preview cards and 1-tap Android widget pinning (`requestPinAppWidget`) in `SettingsScreen.kt`.
- **Widget RemoteViews Inflation & Click Target Fixes (July 2026)**
  - Replaced unsupported layout tags (`<Spacer>` and `<View>`) with `<FrameLayout>` across widget XML layouts to eliminate Android Launcher `InflateException` ("Couldn't load widget").
  - Fixed click target binding by removing root layout click listeners (`widget_bg_...`) and binding screen navigation to specific title text views, allowing inner buttons (`15m`, `30m`, `60m`, refresh) to execute without click interception.
- **Blocker Rules Redesign & Always Block Mode (July 2026)**
  - Removed implicit 24/7 fallbacks from background services, ensuring Keyword Blocker, Website Blocker, and Reels Blocker only run if there is an explicit database rule configured.
  - Added mutually exclusive "Always Block (24/7)" and "Block Schedule" options to rule creator screens for App Blocker, Keyword Blocker, Website Blocker, and Reels Blocker.
  - Migrated Reels count limit configuration (Limit by Reels Scrolled switch and daily limit text field) from the general config screen to the rule creator screen (`CreateReelsBlockerRuleScreen.kt`), updating preferences and broadcasting refresh triggers upon save.
  - Removed count limit mode configuration options from the general Reels Blocker config screen layout (`fragment_reel_blocker_config.xml`) and controller (`FeatureConfigFragments.kt`).
- **Unified Feature Scheduling Purge & Decoupling (July 2026)**
  - Completely deleted the `UnifiedFeatureScheduleRule` database model and periodic switch-flipping scheduling logic.
  - Segregated Keyword Blocker, Website Blocker, and Reels Blocker to execute 24/7 based on global toggles and manual block lists/configurations, matching CureBox's clean, self-contained architecture.
  - Cleaned up Blocks Manager tab (`BlocksFragment`, `BlocksManagerFragment`) to load, list, and edit only App Blocker schedule and limit rules.
  - Deleted the secondary creator screens and cleaned up unused helper methods from `ScheduleUtils.kt`.
- **Blocker-Specific Rule Creators & Mode Gating Removal (July 2026)**
  - Completely removed Simple/Advanced mode selection from onboarding and switches in Settings and Profile. The app now runs uniformly with advanced features always available.
  - Tailored `CreateRuleScreen` to focus purely on App Blocker rules.
- **Simple vs Advanced Mode Enforcement & Usage Limits (July 2026)**
  - Implemented Simple vs Advanced Mode toggle, synchronized in both Settings and Profile screens.
  - In Simple Mode, the warning screen is a hard blocked overlay with no configuration and no proceed button. All rule configurations are hidden/simplified but enforced in the background.
  - Implemented "Usage Limit" rule type, allowing users to define daily foreground usage duration limits (screen time) in hours for selected apps.
  - Built foreground app usage duration checks inside `AppBlocker` by querying `UsageStatsManager` daily stats.
  - Redesigned individual App Blocker Configuration fragment to support selecting blocking modes (Block Schedule, Launch Limit, Usage Limit, Cheat Window) by navigating directly to rule creator prefilled with correct parameters.
- **Focus Mode & Shortform Content Blocker (July 2026)**
  - Re-implemented Focus Mode start experience using a modern Compose-based `StartFocusSessionDialog` featuring custom duration sliders, whitelisting/blacklisting option cards, and background-loaded app list pickers.
  - Implemented Reels/Shorts shortform content tracking in YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok within `AmnShieldAccessibilityService` (counting scrolls and watch time, blocking once limits are hit).
  - Added Reels Scrolled and Reels Watch Time metric blocks to the `StatsScreen.kt` dashboard.
- **High-Fidelity Visual Redesign (July 2026)**
  - Ported the premium modern design system and layouts from `AmnGuard` into `AmnShield-Android`.
  - Redesigned `StatsScreen.kt` with a detailed screen time hero card, circular goal meter, Canvas-drawn weekly bar chart, and modern app breakdown list.
  - Redesigned `FocusScreen.kt` with a Mindfulness & Wellbeing Insights hub, including a pulsing mindful breathing visualizer and interactive focus/distraction simulation tools.
  - Ported and migrated Settings and Profile screens to Compose (`SettingsScreen.kt`, `ProfileScreen.kt`), wiring them into `SettingsFragment` and `ProfileFragment` with local data persistence.
  - Implemented optional Google Account linking on the Profile screen, wired to GMS sign-in/out launcher flow on universal & playstore variants.
  - Ported and migrated Schedules & Rules management and creation screens to Compose (`ManageSchedulesScreen.kt`, `CreateRuleScreen.kt`), replacing `ManageBlockSchedulesFragment` with a clean, unified Compose implementation supporting multi-feature selection, multiple time windows, automatic consolidation, and conflict auto-correction.
  - Updated `Theme.kt` to globally synchronize Android status bar and navigation bar colors to match active themes (Sunset Glow, Emerald Calm, Cosmic Night).
- **Social Media Blocker Integration & Consolidation (July 2026)**
  - Re-implemented the dedicated Social Media Blocker screen matching design requirements (enabling global switch, managing blocked apps, and adding custom blocked websites/domains).
  - Consolidated gaming blocker into general App Blocker to clean up duplicate features.
  - Enforced blocking rules in `AmnShieldAccessibilityService` to intercept blocked social media apps and browser domains.
  - Linked companion app via bound service API to support `SET_SOCIAL_MEDIA_BLOCKER` command for Guardian-based rule enforcement.
- **Scheduling System Consolidation (July 2026)**
  - Consolidated legacy timed scheduling systems (Cheat Hours, Auto-Focus, and Reel Blocker slider ranges) into the unified schedules framework.
  - Retired the redundant `TimedActionActivity`, `AutoTimedActionItem` data model, and custom slider dialogs.
  - Redirected all timed settings buttons to the unified `ManageBlockSchedulesFragment` for a clean, consistent UX.
  - Implemented automatic data migration in `SavedPreferencesLoader` to transition existing users' cheat and auto-focus hours seamlessly.
  - Resolved the bug where auto-focus schedules set in the UI were ignored by the background Accessibility Service.
- **Release Distribution Strategy & CI Workflow (July 2026)**
  - Clarified that `universal` and `fdroid` are the two GitHub Releases APKs; `playstore` goes to Play Console only.
  - Created `release.yml` GitHub Actions workflow: triggers on version tags (`v*.*.*`), signs APKs using keystore stored as GitHub Secret, and auto-publishes `universal` + `fdroid` release APKs to GitHub Releases.
  - Pre-release tags (`-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`) auto-flagged as pre-release on GitHub.
  - Created `README.md` with product flavor guide, correct build commands, Android Studio setup, stale build recovery, and release strategy table.
  - Added **"Building the App"** section to `TESTING_GUIDE.md` documenting flavor-qualified Gradle tasks and stale build fix.
- **Monetization & Licensing Track (July 2026)**
  - Configured custom build-flavor partitioning via `IS_PLAYSTORE` BuildConfig flags.
  - Implemented offline-first ECDSA cryptographic license validator on client builds.
  - Built Deno/TypeScript Supabase Edge Function to parse and verification sign Lemon Squeezy orders.
  - Upgraded Android client to use a versioned keyring map supporting key rotation.
  - Created automated regression test suites verifying signature, expiration, and payload-tamper checks.
- Replaced bottom navigation Settings tab with Blocks dashboard tab
- Added unified Blocks dashboard with live status cards:
  - App Blocker
  - Keyword Blocker
  - Focus Mode
  - Cheat Hours
  - Schedules
  - Launch Limits
- Added floating + setup hub on Blocks dashboard for all-in-one block setup
- Removed About from left drawer to avoid duplication; About remains in overflow menu
- Added launch-limit management flows across:
  - App usage breakdown
  - App Blocker config
  - Dedicated Manage Launch Limits screen
  - Unified schedule/limits management experience
- Added per-app launch tracking and automatic blocking when limit is reached

## Future Roadmap: Global Cloud Sync Architecture (Supabase)

A multi-phase implementation roadmap to establish cross-platform synchronization of rules, schedules, and active focus sessions across Android, Windows, and Web Extension clients using Supabase as the central authority:

### Phase 1: Database Schema & RLS Setup
- Provision tables in Supabase: `profiles`, `devices`, `sync_rules`, and `focus_sessions`.
- Implement Row-Level Security (RLS) policies to isolate user device rules.
- Set up signup triggers linking parental accounts.

### Phase 2: Android App Integration
- Migrate legacy `src/sync` worker code to the active namespace (`com.alhaq.amnshield.data.sync`).
- Bind Google Account authentication in Compose settings to Supabase Auth.
- Implement background `SyncWorker` scheduling via `WorkManager`.
- Configure silent Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) wakeup receivers to trigger real-time updates.
- Fire local IPC broadcasts to keep the companion FireWall app in sync offline.

### Phase 3: Windows Client Integration
- Implement Supabase API REST & WebSocket polling in the Flutter client.
- Securely write synced settings updates to `C:\ProgramData\AmnShield\config.json`.
- Let the background C# Guardian Service / native Dart service watch and apply these rules locally.

### Phase 4: Browser Web Extension Integration
- Dynamic dual-sync: Local HTTP loopback (`127.0.0.1:48192`) when desktop app is active, falling back to Supabase REST for cloud sync.
- Synchronize configurations into `chrome.storage.local`.
- Let content scripts intercept page loads matching the blocked domains.

### Phase 5: Web Administration Console
- Build the Next.js parent administration dashboard.
- Display registered devices and their current status.
- Allow parents to edit blocking rules, schedules, and start focus sessions remotely.
