# Privacy Policy for AmnShield

**Last Updated: 2026-05-15** · _Policy last reviewed for accuracy: 2026-05-29_

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to AmnShield ("we," "our," "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and providing a transparent understanding of how we handle your data. AmnShield is designed with a "privacy-first" approach. Our core mission is to help you build healthier digital habits, and that includes respecting your personal information.

This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding your information. The fundamental principle of AmnShield is that **all sensitive data processing happens entirely on your device.** We do not have servers that collect your personal activity data.

## 2. Information We Collect

To provide our features, AmnShield collects information in the following ways:

### a. Information You Provide to Us

*   **Account Information:** When you choose to sign in with your Google Account, we receive your basic profile information, such as your name and email address, as provided by Google. This is used solely for authentication and managing premium features.
*   **Configuration Data:** You provide us with your preferences and settings, such as lists of blocked applications, blocked keywords, focus mode configurations, and other settings you configure within the app. This data is stored locally on your device.
*   **Schedule and Limit Rules:** App block schedules, grouped unified schedules, and app launch-limit rules are stored locally on your device to enforce your selected controls.

### b. Information Collected Automatically Through App Usage

This is the most sensitive category of data, and we want to be exceptionally clear about it. To perform its functions, AmnShield uses Android's Accessibility Services and other permissions. This data is **processed exclusively on your device** and is **never transmitted to our servers or any third party.**

*   **Application Usage Data:**
    *   We monitor the applications you use (`packageName`) to enforce your app blocking and focus mode rules.
    *   We use Android's `UsageStatsManager` API to gather aggregated screen time for different apps to display usage statistics to you within the app.
*   **On-Screen Content (for Keyword and Wellbeing Features):**
    *   **Keyword Blocker:** The Accessibility Service analyzes text appearing on your screen in real-time to identify and block keywords that you have defined.
    *   **Crucially, all this analysis happens locally.** The text from other apps never leaves your device.
*   **Crash Logs and Error Reports:** The application generates logs when it crashes or encounters errors. These logs contain:
    *   Device information (manufacturer, model, Android version)
    *   App version and error details
    *   System memory usage
    *   Stack trace information
    *   **No sensitive data:** No app content, keywords, or personal information are included in crash logs.
    *   These logs are stored **locally on your device only**.
    *   We only have access to this information if you **explicitly choose** to share it with us via the "Export Report" feature.
*   **User Feedback:** When you submit optional feedback after a crash, you can include:
    *   Your description of what happened
    *   Your email address (optional, for follow-up)
    *   App rating (1-5 stars)
    *   This data is stored **locally on your device only** until you explicitly share it.

## 3. Justification for Permissions

We require certain permissions to provide the features of AmnShield. Here is a detailed explanation of why we need each of the key permissions:

*   **Accessibility Service:** This is the core permission that allows AmnShield to function. We use it to:
    *   Detect the app you are currently using to enforce app blocking and focus mode.
    *   Read the text on your screen to identify and block keywords.
    *   **We do not log or store any of this data.** It is processed in real-time on your device and then discarded.
*   **Package Usage Stats:** This permission allows us to access your app usage history. We use this to:
    *   Show you detailed statistics about your app usage.
    *   **This data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.**
*   **System Alert Window (Overlay):** This permission allows us to display content over other apps. We use this to:
    *   Display the warning screen when a blocked app or view is accessed.
*   **Device Administrator:** This permission is optional and is only required for the Anti-Uninstall feature. It allows us to:
    *   Prevent the app from being uninstalled without your permission.
    *   **This permission does not give us access to any of your personal data.**
*   **VPN Service:** This permission is used for the DNS-based filtering feature. It allows us to:
    *   Filter network traffic to block ads and trackers.
    *   **We do not log or monitor your network traffic.** All filtering is done on your device.
*   **POST_NOTIFICATIONS (Android 13+):** Used to deliver reminders, alerts, and reports that you enable.
*   **RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED:** Used to restore enabled protections and schedules after device restart.
*   **QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES:** Used to detect installed apps for app-blocking setup, category filtering, and auto-block behavior for newly installed apps.
*   **INTERNET:** Used for Google Sign-In, Play Billing verification, optional update checks, and user-initiated feedback/report sharing.

## 4. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect solely to provide and improve the functionality of the AmnShield app.

*   **To Provide Core Features:** Your configuration data and the data from the Accessibility Service are used to make the app, view, and keyword blockers work as you've configured them.
*   **To Enforce Scheduled Controls:** Locally stored schedule and launch-limit data are used to apply time-based blocking, feature toggles, and grouped management actions you configure.
*   **To Display Your Stats:** App usage data is used to generate the charts and statistics you see on the "Stats" screen.
*   **To Authenticate and Manage Your Account:** Your Google Account information is used to sign you in and verify your premium status.
*   **To Maintain Reliability:** Local diagnostics support troubleshooting when you choose to export reports.
*   **To Run Protection Workflows:** Boot restore, install-event auto protection, widgets, and reminders use local settings stored on your device.
*   **To Improve the App:** Anonymized crash logs, which you voluntarily share, help us diagnose and fix bugs.

## 5. How We Do NOT Use Your Information (On-Device Processing)

To reiterate and emphasize our commitment to your privacy:
*   We **DO NOT** transmit your app usage history, blocked keywords, or any on-screen content to our servers.
*   We **DO NOT** sell or share your personal data with third-party advertisers or data brokers.
*   We **DO NOT** have the ability to remotely view your screen or access your personal files.

## 6. Data Sharing and Third Parties

AmnShield is designed to minimize data sharing. We do not share your personal information, except in the limited circumstances described below:

*   **Google Sign-In:** If you sign in, you are sharing information directly with Google, subject to Google's Privacy Policy. We only receive a token to verify your identity.
*   **Google Play Billing:** If you purchase a premium subscription, the transaction is processed by the Google Play Store. We do not collect or store your payment card information.
*   **Legal Requirements:** We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.

## 7. Data Retention and Deletion

All your personal configuration and usage data is stored locally on your device's internal storage. This data is retained as long as you have the AmnShield app installed.

You have full control over your data. You can delete your data in two ways:
1.  **Clearing App Data:** You can go to your device's Settings -> Apps -> AmnShield -> Storage and tap "Clear Data." This will permanently delete all data associated with the app.
2.  **Uninstalling the App:** Uninstalling the AmnShield application will remove the app and all of its associated data from your device.

## 8. Error Reporting and Feedback Control

We give you complete control over error reporting and feedback:

**By Default:**
*   Crash logs and error reports are **stored locally on your device only**
*   We never automatically send them to our servers
*   We never share them with third parties without your permission

**Your Choices:**
*   **Enable/Disable Crash Reporting:** Toggle in Settings → Error Reporting
*   **Enable/Disable Feedback Collection:** Toggle in Settings → Error Reporting
*   **View Your Data:** See exactly what's stored locally in Settings → Error Reporting
*   **Export Your Data:** Share crash logs and feedback via email or other apps (one tap)
*   **Delete Your Data:** Permanently delete all error logs and feedback with one tap

**When You Choose to Share:**
*   You can export all error data as a single text file
*   You choose which app to use (email, cloud storage, messaging, etc.)
*   The report includes crash logs, diagnostics, and any feedback you submitted
*   You can manually add or modify recipient addresses before sending
*   Our support team emails (support@alhaq.uk and alhaq.dst@gmail.com) are pre-filled as CC recipients for convenience

## 9. Your Rights and Choices

You have the following rights regarding your information:
*   **Access and Modify:** You can access and modify your configuration data at any time within the app's settings.
*   **Access Error Data:** View all crash logs and feedback stored on your device anytime
*   **Disable Permissions:** You can disable the Accessibility Service or other permissions for AmnShield at any time through your device's settings. Please note that doing so will cause the core features of the app to stop working.
*   **Opt-out of Account Sync:** You can use the app without signing into a Google account, though premium features may require it.

## 10. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the information stored locally on your device. The app is built on standard Android platform security features. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, especially as the data resides on your personal device, the security of which is outside our control.

## 11. Children's Privacy

AmnShield is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 12. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
